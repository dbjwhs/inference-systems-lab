## Coding Standards & Requirements

### Language & Style Requirements
- **C++17 minimum** - Use modern features (structured bindings, std::optional, std::variant, if constexpr)
- **Template naming**: Modern concept-constrained descriptive naming preferred:
  ```cpp
  template<std::copyable ElementType>  // Preferred modern style
  template<typename T>                 // Acceptable for simple cases
  ```
- **Error Handling**: `Result<T, E>` pattern preferred over exceptions
- **RAII**: Strict resource management, prefer stack allocation
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: Performance-critical code with minimal overhead

### Code Quality Standards
- **Testing Required**: Every piece of code needs comprehensive tests (85%+ coverage target, currently 80.67%)
- **Enterprise Test Standards**: Multi-phase systematic approach to coverage excellence
- **Documentation**: All public APIs require Doxygen-style documentation with examples
- **Performance**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical components
- **Memory Safety**: AddressSanitizer, UBSan integration, no memory leaks
- **Build Quality**: Zero warnings, clean static analysis, automated quality gates

### CRITICAL: Code Cleanliness Standards
**THESE PRACTICES ARE ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED:**

- **❌ NEVER commit commented-out code** - Use git history for deleted code
- **❌ NO dead code or disabled functionality** - Remove unused code completely  
- **❌ NO "temporary" commented blocks** - They become permanent technical debt
- **❌ NO debugging artifacts left in commits** - Clean up before committing

**Why this matters:** Commented code creates maintenance burden, confusion about intent, and violates professional engineering standards. Git already preserves deleted code history.

**Correct approaches instead:**
- **Use appropriate log levels**: `LOG_DEBUG_PRINT()` for development diagnostics
- **Conditional compilation**: `#ifdef DEBUG` for debug-only code
- **Complete removal**: Delete unused code entirely - git preserves the history
- **Feature flags**: For incomplete features, use runtime configuration

**This standard is NON-NEGOTIABLE** - violations will require immediate fixes.

### File & Naming Conventions
- **Headers**: `.hpp` extension (not `.h`)
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` 
- **Functions/Methods**: `snake_case`
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Template Parameters**: `PascalCase` (modern descriptive names)
- **Namespaces**: `lower_snake_case`

## Key Design Patterns & Components

### Result<T, E> Error Handling
```cpp
// Modern error handling without exceptions
auto parse_config() -> Result<Config, ParseError> {
    return Config::from_file("config.json")
        .and_then([](Config cfg) { return cfg.validate(); })
        .map_err([](ParseError err) { return err.add_context("config load"); });
}

// ❌ NEVER do this - unsafe unwrap
auto result = risky_operation();
auto value = std::move(result).unwrap();  // Segfault if result.is_err()

// ✅ ALWAYS check first
auto result = risky_operation();
if (result.is_err()) {
    // Handle error appropriately for context
    return; // or throw, or skip, etc.
}
auto value = std::move(result).unwrap();
```

### Schema Evolution System (NEW)
```cpp
// Semantic versioning with compatibility checking
SchemaVersion v1_0_0(1, 0, 0);
SchemaVersion v1_1_0(1, 1, 0);

// Migration path definition
MigrationPath path(v1_0_0, v1_1_0, 
                   MigrationPath::Strategy::DEFAULT_VALUES,
                   true, "Added optional schema version fields");

// Evolution manager for coordinating migrations
SchemaEvolutionManager manager(v1_1_0);
manager.register_migration_path(path);

// Automatic migration during deserialization
auto migrated_fact = manager.migrate_fact(old_fact, v1_0_0);
```

### Builder Pattern for Complex Objects
```cpp
// Fluent interface for object construction
auto rule = RuleBuilder()
    .with_id(1)
    .with_name("mortality_rule")
    .with_condition("isHuman", {"X"})
    .with_conclusion("isMortal", {"X"})
    .with_priority(10)
    .build();
```

### Performance-Oriented Value Types
```cpp
// Type-safe polymorphic values with zero-cost abstractions
Value val = Value::from_int64(42);
if (auto int_val = val.try_as_int64()) {
    // Safe extraction without exceptions
    process_integer(*int_val);
}
```

## Testing & Performance Philosophy

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests** for all public APIs (GoogleTest framework)
- **Integration tests** for component interactions  
- **Performance benchmarks** for critical paths (Google Benchmark)
- **Property-based testing** for algorithmic components
- **Memory safety** validation with sanitizers

### Performance Guidelines  
- **Measure first, optimize second** - All optimizations need benchmarks
- **Cache-friendly design** - Keep hot data together, minimize pointer chasing
- **SIMD considerations** - Design data structures for vectorization
- **Custom allocators** for performance-critical sections

// Planned unified interface integrating with existing patterns
enum class InferenceBackend : std::uint8_t { 
    RULE_BASED, 
    TENSORRT_GPU, 
    ONNX_RUNTIME,
    HYBRID_NEURAL_SYMBOLIC 
};

auto create_inference_engine(InferenceBackend backend, const ModelConfig& config) 
    -> Result<std::unique_ptr<InferenceEngine>, InferenceError>;

// Integration with existing Result<T,E> and logging patterns
auto run_inference(const InferenceRequest& request) 
    -> Result<InferenceResponse, InferenceError>;
```

### Technical Integration Points

- **Logging**: Integrate ML inference metrics with existing structured logging system
- **Schema Evolution**: Apply versioning patterns to ML model lifecycle management  
- **Benchmarking**: Leverage existing performance framework for ML workload comparisons
- **Testing**: Apply existing quality standards (80%+ coverage, comprehensive test suites)
- **Development Workflow**: Use existing automation (pre-commit hooks, static analysis)

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### **CRITICAL: Pull Request Workflow (MANDATORY)**

**❌ NEVER commit directly to main branch**
- All changes MUST go through pull request review process
- User needs to view and approve all pull requests before merging
- This applies to ALL commits, regardless of size or type

**✅ ALWAYS use feature branch workflow:**
```bash
# Create feature branch for new work
git checkout -b feature/description-of-work

# Make changes, commit to feature branch
git add . && git commit -m "Implementation details"

# Push feature branch and create PR
git push -u origin feature/description-of-work
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"
```

**Why this matters:** Direct commits to main bypass code review, quality gates, and approval processes that are essential for production systems.

When working on this project:

1. **Quality First**: All code must pass formatting, static analysis, and comprehensive tests
2. **Modern C++17+**: Use advanced language features appropriately (structured bindings, concepts, etc.)
3. **Testing Mandatory**: Every component needs comprehensive test coverage
4. **Performance Aware**: Include benchmarks for performance-critical code
5. **Documentation Required**: All public APIs need Doxygen documentation with examples
6. **Follow Patterns**: Study existing code in `common/` for established patterns
7. **Build Testing**: Verify changes don't break compilation or existing functionality

### CRITICAL: Problem-Solving Standards

**❌ NEVER take shortcuts when fixing issues:**
- **DO NOT disable or comment out failing code** - This is absolutely unacceptable
- **DO NOT bypass problems** - Fix the underlying architectural issues systematically  
- **DO NOT prioritize speed over quality** - Especially under pressure when standards matter most

**✅ ALWAYS fix root causes:**
- **Fix API mismatches properly** - Update method calls to match actual interfaces
- **Resolve namespace conflicts** - Use proper scoping and aliases
- **Implement missing methods** - Don't comment out calls to non-existent functions
- **Test define expected behavior** - They are specifications that drive implementation

**Why this matters:** Taking shortcuts creates technical debt and violates the engineering standards this project maintains. When builds break, the solution is systematic fixes, never disabling functionality.

### Useful Commands for Development
- `python3 python_tool/run_comprehensive_tests.py` - Complete testing: all configs, all tests (RECOMMENDED)
- `python3 python_tool/run_comprehensive_tests.py --quick` - Quick smoke tests for development
- `python3 python_tool/run_comprehensive_tests.py --memory` - Memory safety focused testing
- `make clean && make -j4` - Clean build to verify no compilation issues
- `ctest --output-on-failure` - Run all tests with detailed failure output
- `python3 python_tool/check_format.py --fix` - Fix formatting issues
- `python3 python_tool/check_static_analysis.py --check` - Verify static analysis
- `python3 python_tool/run_benchmarks.py` - Check performance benchmarks

### Pre-Commit Workflow Best Practices
**IMPORTANT**: To avoid commit/hook/fix/commit churn, always run formatting before committing:

```bash
# Recommended workflow before any commit:
python3 python_tool/check_format.py --fix --staged    # Fix formatting for staged files
git add -A                                       # Stage formatting fixes
git commit -m "Your commit message"              # Commit with clean formatting

# Alternative: Run all quality checks at once
python3 python_tool/check_format.py --fix
python3 python_tool/check_static_analysis.py --check --severity warning
git add -A && git commit -m "Your message"

# Emergency bypass (use sparingly)
git commit --no-verify -m "Your message"        # Skip pre-commit hooks
```

**Why this matters**: Pre-commit hooks will block commits with formatting violations, leading to a frustrating cycle of commit → hook failure → fix → commit again. Running the formatter first eliminates this churn and ensures smooth development workflow.
