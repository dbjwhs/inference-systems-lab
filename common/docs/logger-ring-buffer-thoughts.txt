Do I need thread-safe ring buffer implementation for my logging class.

Below is my thoughts, so currently not needed but keep this for history and future work.

  Current mutex-based approach pros:
  - Simple and reliable
  - Immediate disk persistence (good for crash recovery)
  - Easy to debug and reason about
  - Sufficient for most applications

  Thread-safe ring buffer pros:
  - Much better performance for high-frequency logging
  - Reduces lock contention between threads
  - Allows batch I/O operations
  - Decouples logging calls from disk I/O latency

  When you'd benefit from a ring buffer:
  - High-frequency logging (thousands of messages/second)
  - Many threads logging simultaneously
  - Performance-critical applications where logging overhead matters
  - When I/O latency is causing bottlenecks

  When your current approach is fine:
  - Moderate logging frequency
  - Small number of logging threads
  - Applications where logging isn't a performance bottleneck
  - When you need guaranteed immediate persistence

  Questions to consider:
  1. How frequently will you be logging? (messages per second)
  2. How many threads will be logging simultaneously?
  3. Is logging performance critical for your inference systems?
  4. Do you need immediate disk persistence or can you tolerate buffered writes?
