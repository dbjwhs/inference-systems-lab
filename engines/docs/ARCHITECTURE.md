# Inference Engines Architecture

## Overview

The engines domain implements various inference algorithms and reasoning systems using modern C++17+ features.

## Key Components

### Forward Chaining Engine
- **Purpose**: Data-driven inference from facts to conclusions
- **Modern C++ Features**: 
  - `std::variant` for rule representation
  - `if constexpr` for compile-time optimization
  - Parallel algorithms for concurrent rule evaluation

### Backward Chaining Engine  
- **Purpose**: Goal-driven inference from conclusions to supporting facts
- **Implementation Notes**: Stack-based goal resolution with efficient backtracking

### Rule Engine
- **Purpose**: Generic rule processing framework
- **Features**: Pattern matching, conflict resolution, rule priorities

### Fact Store
- **Purpose**: Efficient storage and retrieval of facts
- **Optimizations**: Memory layout optimization, fast lookup structures

## Performance Considerations

- Memory pool allocation for frequent fact creation/deletion
- SIMD optimizations for pattern matching where applicable
- Lock-free data structures for concurrent access

## Integration Points

- **Distributed**: Fact synchronization across nodes
- **Performance**: Memory and CPU optimization
- **Integration**: End-to-end inference scenarios
