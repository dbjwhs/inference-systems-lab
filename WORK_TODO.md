  - **Zero user impact**: All existing build commands work identically (tools/setup.sh, cmake, make)
  - **Validated compatibility**: Complete build, test, and sanitizer functionality preserved
  - Sets foundation for future build system enhancements and cross-project module sharing

- **âœ… Comprehensive sanitizer support** - Runtime error detection infrastructure:
  - Enhanced CMake configuration with user-friendly SANITIZER_TYPE option (none, address, thread, memory, undefined, address+undefined)
  - Implemented compatibility checks preventing incompatible sanitizer combinations (e.g., AddressSanitizer vs ThreadSanitizer)
  - Added comprehensive UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer checks (signed-integer-overflow, null, bounds, alignment, object-size, vptr)
  - Enhanced tools/setup.sh with --sanitizer command-line option and improved help documentation
  - Fixed DEBUG macro naming conflict (DEBUG â†’ INFERENCE_LAB_DEBUG) to resolve compilation with LogLevel::DEBUG enum
  - **Validated clean codebase**: All tests pass with sanitizers enabled, no memory errors or undefined behavior detected
  - **Performance impact documented**: AddressSanitizer ~2x slower, UBSan ~20% overhead, warnings included in benchmark output
  - **Usage examples**: `tools/setup.sh --debug --sanitizer address+undefined` for development builds
  - Addresses build system foundation requirement for runtime error detection during development and testing

### Previously Completed (2025-08-16)

- **âœ… Build system stability and Apple Silicon compatibility** - Complete resolution of build issues:
  - Fixed Apple Silicon M3 Max linker errors (`ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64`)
  - Resolved GTest ABI compatibility with automatic system vs FetchContent detection
  - Added proper Google Benchmark integration with `benchmark_main` linking
  - Created placeholder implementations for all modules (engines, distributed, performance, integration)
  - Eliminated all 19+ build warnings achieving zero-warning compilation
  - Used modern C++17 `[[maybe_unused]]` attribute for clean code suppression
  - Fixed unused parameters, variables, type aliases, lambda captures, and expression results
  - Added meaningful test assertions replacing simple warning suppression
  - All 8 test suites (53 total tests) pass with 100% success rate

- **âœ… Modern template parameter naming implementation** - Strategic modernization per DEVELOPMENT.md standards:

  - Applied modern naming to logging.hpp template functions (print_log, format_message helpers)
  - Updated inference_builders.hpp factory functions (fact, findAll, prove) with ArgumentTypes
  - Enhanced result_usage_examples.cpp with OperationType parameter naming
  - **Pragmatic approach**: Focused on high-impact public APIs rather than internal implementation details
