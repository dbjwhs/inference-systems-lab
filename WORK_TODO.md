### Recently Completed (2025-08-17)

- **✅ Modular CMake build system** - Organized and maintainable build configuration:
  - Refactored monolithic CMakeLists.txt (242 lines) into focused, reusable modules
  - Created 7 specialized CMake modules: CompilerOptions, Sanitizers, Testing, Benchmarking, Documentation, StaticAnalysis, PackageConfig
  - **Reduced complexity**: Main CMakeLists.txt reduced by 60% (242 → 97 lines) while maintaining identical functionality
  - **Enhanced maintainability**: Each module has single responsibility and clear separation of concerns
  - **Improved reusability**: Modules can be shared across projects and individually tested
  - **Better organization**: Related build functionality logically grouped (warnings, sanitizers, testing, etc.)
  - **Cleaner configuration**: Enhanced status display with detailed module breakdown
  - **Zero user impact**: All existing build commands work identically (tools/setup.sh, cmake, make)
  - **Validated compatibility**: Complete build, test, and sanitizer functionality preserved
  - Sets foundation for future build system enhancements and cross-project module sharing

- **✅ Comprehensive sanitizer support** - Runtime error detection infrastructure:
  - Enhanced CMake configuration with user-friendly SANITIZER_TYPE option (none, address, thread, memory, undefined, address+undefined)
  - Implemented compatibility checks preventing incompatible sanitizer combinations (e.g., AddressSanitizer vs ThreadSanitizer)
  - Added comprehensive UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer checks (signed-integer-overflow, null, bounds, alignment, object-size, vptr)
  - Enhanced tools/setup.sh with --sanitizer command-line option and improved help documentation
  - Fixed DEBUG macro naming conflict (DEBUG → INFERENCE_LAB_DEBUG) to resolve compilation with LogLevel::DEBUG enum
  - **Validated clean codebase**: All tests pass with sanitizers enabled, no memory errors or undefined behavior detected
  - **Performance impact documented**: AddressSanitizer ~2x slower, UBSan ~20% overhead, warnings included in benchmark output
  - **Usage examples**: `tools/setup.sh --debug --sanitizer address+undefined` for development builds
  - Addresses build system foundation requirement for runtime error detection during development and testing
