## Getting Started

### **For New Claude Code Instances or Team Members:**

**🎯 Current Project State Assessment**
1. **Review Foundation**: Read `CLAUDE.md` for complete project context and current Phase 7B completion status
2. **Examine Implemented POCs**: Study `engines/src/momentum_bp/`, `circular_bp/`, and `mamba_ssm/` for established patterns
3. **Understand Benchmarking**: Run `./build/engines/unified_inference_benchmarks` to see comparative performance analysis
4. **Explore Python Tooling**: Navigate to `python_tool/` directory and run `./setup_python.sh` for development environment

**🚀 Ready to Contribute - Next Implementation**
1. **Start with MoE Implementation**: Follow the detailed implementation strategy in "🚀 Immediate Next Steps" section above  
2. **Use Existing Scaffolding**: Leverage `python_tool/new_module.py` for complete module structure generation
3. **Follow Established Patterns**: Study existing POC implementations for integration with `Result<T,E>`, memory pools, and SIMD optimization
4. **Apply Quality Standards**: Maintain 87%+ test coverage and zero-warning build standards established in previous phases

**📋 Alternative Development Paths**
- **Infrastructure Focus**: Work on advanced integration, memory profiling, or production deployment features
- **Research Focus**: Begin preliminary research for Neuro-Symbolic Logic Programming (Phase 7D)
- **Optimization Focus**: Cross-technique performance analysis and hybrid inference patterns

**🛠️ Development Environment Ready**
All infrastructure is in place for immediate development:
- ✅ Enterprise-grade build system with ML framework detection  
- ✅ Comprehensive testing framework with multiple sanitizers
- ✅ Professional Python tooling with virtual environment and uv package manager
- ✅ Complete CI/CD pipeline with pre-commit hooks and quality gates
- ✅ Three production-ready POC implementations as reference patterns

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current sophisticated foundation to the next breakthrough implementation, with all supporting infrastructure ready for immediate productivity.
