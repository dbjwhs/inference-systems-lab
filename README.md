# Inference Systems Laboratory

A modern C++17+ research and learning platform for exploring inference engines, distributed systems, and performance-critical infrastructure. This laboratory provides hands-on implementations of rule-based reasoning, consensus algorithms, and high-performance computing patterns with comprehensive benchmarking and testing.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This laboratory serves as a comprehensive learning environment for:

- **Inference Engine Design**: Implementing forward-chaining, backward-chaining, and hybrid reasoning systems
- **Distributed Systems**: Building consensus algorithms, distributed state machines, and fault-tolerant architectures  
- **Performance Engineering**: Optimizing critical paths, memory management, and concurrent processing
- **System Integration**: Combining inference, distribution, and performance in real-world scenarios

## 🚀 Modern C++17+ Features

This project leverages cutting-edge C++17+ capabilities:

- **`std::variant`** - Type-safe unions for inference rule representations and distributed message types
- **`if constexpr`** - Compile-time branching for template specializations in performance-critical code
- **Structured bindings** - Clean tuple/pair decomposition in distributed protocol handling
- **Parallel algorithms** - `std::execution::par` for concurrent rule evaluation and batch processing
