# Distributed Systems Protocols

## Overview

The distributed domain implements consensus algorithms and distributed state management for fault-tolerant inference systems.

## Key Protocols

### Raft Consensus
- **Purpose**: Leader election and log replication for distributed fact storage
- **Modern C++ Features**:
  - `std::variant` for different message types
  - Structured bindings for message parsing
  - `std::optional` for safe null handling

### Distributed State Machine
- **Purpose**: Coordinated state transitions across multiple nodes
- **Implementation**: Event sourcing with deterministic replay

### Node Discovery
- **Purpose**: Dynamic cluster membership management
- **Features**: Failure detection, network partition handling

### Message Passing
- **Purpose**: Efficient inter-node communication
- **Optimizations**: Zero-copy serialization, batched operations

## Fault Tolerance

- Byzantine fault tolerance considerations
- Network partition recovery
- Split-brain prevention

## Performance Characteristics

- Target latency: <10ms local cluster, <100ms WAN
- Throughput: Support for high-frequency fact updates
- Memory efficiency: Minimal per-node overhead

## Integration with Inference

- Distributed fact storage and retrieval
- Coordinated rule evaluation across nodes
- Conflict resolution in distributed environments
